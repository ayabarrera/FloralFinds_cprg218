DELEGATION OF TASKS:

Our group decided it was best to work on the HTML framework in class (the week where
we had our asynchronous) since working together, in-person, would give us a higher chance of
figuring out the codes that we needed.
The way we divided the CSS codes for the sections were:
Alyanna – Navigation bar, hero, & review (I just wanted to add this, it wasn’t originally
part of the framework)
Tasia – Embedded video & card
Karl – Footer & about
Although we were assigned specific tasks, we were working hand-in-hand in figuring out
the codes for the sections. We thought that having just one person working on the card and
accordion section was too much, so we ended up coding the “difficult” (accordion & card)
section together, in-class as well. Looking for photos, videos, and fonts were also a group effort.
